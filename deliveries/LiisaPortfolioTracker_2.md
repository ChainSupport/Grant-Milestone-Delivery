# Milestone Delivery :mailbox:

> âš¡ Only the GitHub account that submitted the application is allowed to submit milestones. 
> 
> Don't remove any of the mandatory parts presented in bold letters or as headlines! Lines starting with `>`, such as this one, can be removed.

**The delivery is according to the official [milestone delivery guidelines](https://github.com/w3f/Grants-Program/blob/master/docs/Support%20Docs/milestone-deliverables-guidelines.md).**  

* **Application Document:** In the case of a public [Grants Program](https://github.com/w3f/Grants-Program) application, please provide a link to the merged contract (the `.md` file in the [applications](https://github.com/w3f/Grants-Program/tree/master/applications) directory). In the case of a private application, please provide the name of the project. 
* **Milestone Number:** e.g. 1

**Context** (optional)
> Please provide a short paragraph or two connecting the deliverables in this milestone and describing their purpose.

**Deliverables**
> Please provide a list of all deliverables of the milestone extracted from the initial application and a link to the deliverable itself. Ideally all links inside the below table should include a commit hash, which will be used for testing. If you don't provide a commit hash, we will work off the default branch of your repository. Thus, if you plan on continuing work after delivery, we suggest you create a separate branch for either the delivery or your continuing work. 
> 
> If there is anything particular about any of the deliverables we or a future reader should know, use the respective `Notes` column.
