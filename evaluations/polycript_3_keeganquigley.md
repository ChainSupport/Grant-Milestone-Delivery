| 3.1    | Efficiency Improvements   | https://github.com/perun-network/polkadot-wallet-grant/wiki |Deviation: We instead present a generic TCVRF scheme that can bring effiency improvements for threshold signing protocols or derivations in threshold wallets.      |
| 3.2    | Stronger Security Model   | https://github.com/perun-network/polkadot-wallet-grant/wiki | Deviation: We instead develop a formal model for Threshold Committing VRFs, which are a generalization of TeVRFs |
